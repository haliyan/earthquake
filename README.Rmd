# earthquake

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of earthquake is to clean, map, and visualize raw NOAA earthquake data. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of earthquake like so: Enter \code{install_github("haliyan/earthquake")} into the console. 

*Note: using the \code{install_github()} function requires that the \code{devtools} package be installed and loaded. \code{devtools} can be
installed using \code{install_packages("devtools")} and loaded using 
\code{library(devtools)}.* 

Once the \code{earthquake} package is installed, load it using the code
\code{library(earthquake)}. 

## Data 
The NOAA data were sourced from [this web page](www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-data) 
Download the most recent version of the data by clicking the download button in the top left hand corner of the page. 
Once the data has been downloaded, read it into R using \code{readr::read_delim()} as follows: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_name<-readr::read_delim("download_name.tsv",delim="\t")
```

Substitute "data_name" with the desired name for the data.frame in R (e.g. earthquake_data) and "download_name" with the name of the downloaded file. 

Note that a version of the NOAA earthquake dataset is provided in this package for examples and testing purposes. 
**This is NOT the most up-to-date version of the data set and should NOT be used for analysis. It is recommended that the user download the most recent version of the earthquake data and load it into R as shown above.** 
To access the version included in the package for examples or practice, use the following code: 

```{r}
filename<-system.file("extdata","noaa_earthquakes.tsv", package="earthquake")
eq_data<-read.delim(filename, header=TRUE)
#substitute eq_data with any desired name for the data 
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(earthquake)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
