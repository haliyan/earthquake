The goal of earthquake is to clean, map, and visualize raw NOAA earthquake data. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of earthquake like so: 
Enter `install_github("haliyan/earthquake")` into the console. 

*Note: using the `install_github()` function requires that the `devtools` package be installed and loaded. `devtools` can be
installed using `install_packages("devtools")` and loaded using 
`library(devtools)`.* 

Once the `earthquake` package is installed, load it using the code
`library(earthquake)`. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(earthquake)
library(knitr)
```

## Data 
The NOAA data were sourced from [this web page](https://data.noaa.gov/metaview/page?xml=NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC/MGG/Hazards/iso/xml/G012153.xml&view=getDataView).

Download the most recent version of the data by selecting "NCEI/WDS Global Significant Earthquake Database", then scrolling down and clicking "Search". Then click the download button in the top left hand corner of the page. 

Once the data has been downloaded, read it into R using `readr::read_delim()` as follows: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_name<-readr::read_delim("download_name.tsv",delim="\t")
```

Substitute "data_name" with the desired name for the data.frame in R (e.g. earthquake_data) and "download_name" with the name of the downloaded file. 

Note that a version of the NOAA earthquake dataset is provided in this package for examples and testing purposes. 
**This is NOT the most up-to-date version of the data set and should NOT be used for analysis. It is recommended that the user download the most recent version of the earthquake data and load it into R as shown above.** 
To access the version included in the package for examples or practice, use the following code: 

```{r}
data(eq)
```

The object `eq` will now be saved into the environment and can be cleaned and visualized. 

## Examples

Data can be cleaned using the `eq_raw_cleaner` function. 
```{r}
eq_clean<-eq_raw_cleaner(eq)
```

Once cleaned, the data can be plotted as part of a ggplot object using the timeline geom.  
The following code also demonstrates the `bc_date()` and `year_pad()` functions in action. 

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data=eq_clean, 
                ggplot2::aes(x=Date,
                             xmin=bc_date(y="-033"),
                             xmax=year_pad(y="11"),
                             colour=Latitude,
                             fill=Latitude)) +
  geom_timeline(size=5) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Earthquakes from 33BC to 11AD")
```

Another example of the timeline geom shows how the y-aesthetic can be used. 

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data=eq_clean, 
                ggplot2::aes(x=Date, 
                             xmin=as.Date("2022-02-25"),
                             xmax=as.Date("2022-03-22"),
                             y=Mag,
                             col=`Total Injuries`,
                             fill=`Total Injuries`)) +
                  geom_timeline(size=5) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Selection of 2022 Earthquakes by Magnitude")
```

The earthquake data can also be plotted with the timeline label geom. The following plot shows some earthquakes that occurred in early 2022 with the 2 largest (by magnitude) earthquakes' countries labeled. 

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data=eq_clean,
                ggplot2::aes(x=Date,
                             xmin=as.Date("2022-01-07"),
                             xmax=as.Date("2022-03-27"),
                             max_by=Mag,
                             txt=Country,
                             n_max=3,
                             col=Mag,
                             fill=Mag)) +
  geom_timeline_label() +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Early 2022 Earthquakes")
```

Finally, the data can be mapped in Leaflet with the `eq_map` function.

The `eq_create_label()` function can be used to create popup text (which contains information about earthquake location, magnitude, and number of deaths caused) for each point displayed on the map. 
The image included is a screenshot of the map generated from the code below:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
eq_popup_data<-dplyr::mutate(tail(eq_clean,10), text=eq_create_label(tail(eq_clean,10)))
eq_map(eq_popup_data, 
       color= eq_popup_data$Mag, 
       annot_col=eq_popup_data$text)
```

When the code is run in R, a fully interactive Leaflet map (with popups) will be created.
